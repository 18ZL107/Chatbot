# Overview
This project is  to create a simple functional chatbot, called Eatbot, for existing app UberEats. EatBot aims to improve consumers’ entire experience by offering enhanced functionalities and meal delivery services on their mobile and desktop application with target audience being all the users of food delivery services. Our EatBot will assist users while browsing menus, helping with their eating habits through data analysis and providing better customer support. This will be offered through enhanced recommendations as well as integrating new functionalities to create competitive advantage in the food delivery service industry.

## Dataset Description
These two simulated datasets comprise essential details about restaurants and user demographics, aiding us in constructing robust business scenarios for Eatbot.
### Restaurants Data
- Budget Range: estimated budget range for the restaurant
- Suitable Occasions: recommended suitable occasion
- Average Waiting Time: for delivery in minutes

## Business Scenarios 
### Image Recognition
User can upload or provide URL of a image and the chatbot will match it to a dish on the application
### Surprise Food Box
Creation of a complete surprise meal selection by the chatbot
### Recommendation & Meal Plans
Added feature based on budget, occasion, etc.
### EatsWrapped
Using customer data to create fun, shareable infographics

## Business Value
- EatBot stays within UberEats’ core business and branding
- It enhances the current customer experience through its new features that still align with current UberEats
  - For example, by creating meal plans, EatBot transforms the limited filtering options that leaves everything up to the user, to creating detailed and tailored plans with little to no effort from the user
- Each new feature is a simple but effective way to leverage Uber’s massive amounts of data to give users the impression that they are getting superior service on UberEats
- EatBot will allow UberEats to capture more market share and generate a competitive advantage over other delivery apps by demonstrating differentiation 
- This will in turn allow for increased sales and profitability
